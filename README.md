Basics:

What MRI measures depends on the pulse sequence (ask Mikko Nissi) 
Reconstruction and Pre-processing (very low-level)
(probably not) Modality specific pre-processing (fMRI (fmriprep), DTI)
Image formats (NIfti but also others mentioned analyze, MINC, Mgh, vendor specific formats, BIDS)
pipelines

Registration:
Intra-subject registration
Concept  of stereotactic space
Registration to stereotactic space
Registration algorithms (cost-functions, transforms, optimization, interpolation)
Point-based registration

Basics of neuroanatomy  (mainly where to look for more information)

Segmentation:
Atlases
Tissue-classification (non-university correction often jointly)
multiatlas methods 
skull-stripping 
CNN-based
Cortical surface extraction 
Morphometry 

Statistics: First stat-image per individual then analysis  

fMRI (GLM, connectivity)

Stats: Multiple comparisons 

Connectivity (fMRI, tractography)
