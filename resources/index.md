# A short guide to neuroimaging resources

## Books, lecture notes and similar

Poldrack, Mumford, Nichols: Handbook of Functional MRI Data Analysis: [https://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Functional-MRI-Data-Analysis/dp/0521517664/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1307113870&sr=8-1] . This is a definite book about fMRI data analysis, very clear and useful also for other modalities. The book is easy to read.  

SPM documentation and books: https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/doc/ There are lots of great resources about, for example, statistical analyses. Some of the books are bit old but still very essentials reads.   

A very useful piece of lecture notes http://jpeelle.net/mri/ that nicely completements the previous ones oncentrating on structural MRI.
