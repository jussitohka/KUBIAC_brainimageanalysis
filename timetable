Introduction (with a light touch)

  - MRI acquisition, its parameters, and the different results
  - gradient & spin echo?
  - k-space (what is it, how is it filled (in a simple case))
  - reconstruction (only the idea with inverse Fourier)

Pre-processing

  - inter subject co-registration
    - linear and nonlinear
      - rigid - 6 parameters, 3 translation, 3 rotation
      - affine - 12 parameters
      - show 4x4 transform matrix and talk about the components
      - non-linear co-registration
        - talk about the liberties added compared to the linear case
        - ultimately everything fits everything -> we need constraints
        - in our case, one such constraint could be nearby objects should remain nearby objects after transform
    - also would like to perform transformations backwards without computing the transforms again
      - 4x4 matrix transpose is the inverse
      - non-linear mapping is not that easy to invert? -> some mechanism needed; estimation of both directions simultaneously?
    - metrics CC & MI
      - cross correlation - same to same - show images and scatter plots
      - mutual information - different to different - show images, talk about common information, show scatterplot -> no correlation, show joint information scatter -> correlation
    - how does this simplify to intra-subject?
      - only rigid needed?

  - MRI (time-)series preprocessing
    - fMRI & dMRI
    - motion correction (with references to co-reg; rigid w CC or GC)
    - fMRI specific: slice-timing
    - dMRI specific: eddy current correction

    - how does the process look like (when using the tools presented earlier)
       - show with images & videos

  - time-series analyses -> activation maps; ICA-maps
  - DTI fitting -> FA, MD, ...


Processing to produce parametric maps from the data
Analyses

Connectivity - functional (network of coehrent something) + diffusion (tractographic projection of local orientation distributions

Statistics

Individual fMRI data -> individual parametric map(s)

Individual PMs -> voxel-based group statistics (different groups, co-variates, repeated-measures,)
