Introduction (with a light touch)

  - MRI acquisition, its parameters, and the different results
  - gradient & spin echo?
  - k-space (what is it, how is it filled (in a simple case))
  - reconstruction (only the idea with inverse Fourier)

Pre-processing

  - show the whole pre-processing pipeline here

  - inter subject co-registration
    - linear and nonlinear
      - rigid - 6 parameters, 3 translation, 3 rotation
      - affine - 12 parameters
      - show 4x4 transform matrix and talk about the components
      - non-linear co-registration
        - talk about the liberties added compared to the linear case
        - ultimately everything fits everything -> we need constraints
        - in our case, one such constraint could be nearby objects should remain nearby objects after transform
    - also would like to perform transformations backwards without computing the transforms again
      - 4x4 matrix transpose is the inverse
      - non-linear mapping is not that easy to invert? -> some mechanism needed; estimation of both directions simultaneously?
    - metrics CC & MI
      - cross correlation - same to same - show images and scatter plots
      - mutual information - different to different - show images, talk about common information, show scatterplot -> no correlation, show joint information scatter -> correlation
    - how does this simplify to intra-subject?
      - only rigid needed?

  - MRI (time-)series preprocessing
    - fMRI & dMRI
      - series of 3D volumes
      - fMRI: blood oxygen-induced changes in the time-series
      - dMRI: diffusion sensitizing gradient-induced differences in the volumes
      - show in video
    - if the series contain subject motion, voxel (time-)series are not reliable
    - motion correction (with references to co-reg; rigid w CC-type metric)
      - rigid co-reg if no acquisition-induced distortions
      - video of pre and post
    - fMRI specific: slice-timing
      - 2D acquisitions - if slices are 
    - dMRI specific: eddy current correction
      - gradient changes induce eddy currents that can be corrected with specialiced algorigthms
      - any way to show the distortions?
    
    - smoothing
      - to improve SNR in the voxels
      - gaussian kernel -> distance-weighted average
      - should not be used if ROIs used

  - show the whole pre-processing pipeline here
    - how does the process look like (when using the tools presented earlier)
       - show with images & videos
       - voxel time-series before and after the process?

Processing to produce parametric maps from the data
  - time-series analyses -> activation maps; ICA-maps
  - DTI fitting -> FA, MD, ...
    - tensor model - ellipsoid
    - eigen decomposition -> eigenvalues and vectors
    - eigenvalues -> parametric maps FA, MD show these


Analyses

Connectivity - functional (network of coehrent something) + diffusion (tractographic projection of local orientation distributions

Statistics

Individual fMRI data -> individual parametric map(s)

Individual ParaMaps -> voxel-based group statistics (different groups, co-variates, repeated-measures,)
