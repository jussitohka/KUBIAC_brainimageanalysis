Introduction (with a light touch)

  - MRI acquisition, its parameters, and the different results
  - gradient & spin echo?
  - k-space (what is it, how is it filled (in a simple case))
  - reconstruction (only the idea with inverse Fourier)

Pre-processing

  - inter subject co-registration
    - linear and nonlinear
    - metrics CC & MI
    - how does this simplify to intra-subject?

  - MRI (time-)series preprocessing
    - fMRI & dMRI
    - motion correction (with references to co-reg; rigid w CC or GC)
    - fMRI specific: slice-timing
    - dMRI specific: eddy current correction

    - how does the process look like (when using the tools presented earlier)
       - show with images & videos

  - time-series analyses -> activation maps; ICA-maps
  - DTI fitting -> FA, MD, ...


Processing to produce parametric maps from the data
Analyses

Connectivity - functional (network of coehrent something) + diffusion (tractographic projection of local orientation distributions

Statistics

Individual fMRI data -> individual parametric map(s)

Individual PMs -> voxel-based group statistics (different groups, co-variates, repeated-measures,)
